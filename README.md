Added the get current weather command, has not been tested yet.

Currently there is an issue with my get_weather_forecast method, there is a key error.

After a glance I put ['[city] instead of having only one pair of brackets, which created an error. Deleting this bracket allowed the code to work, and now displays the forecast in 3 hour increments.
